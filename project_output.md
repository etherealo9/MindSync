## Addressing Technical Challenges

### Real-Time Data Synchronization
Implemented Supabase real-time subscriptions to ensure instant updates across all user sessions when tasks are created, updated, or completed. The challenge of maintaining data consistency across multiple browser tabs and devices was solved through careful state management and optimistic updates.

### AI Provider Reliability
Developed a fallback system supporting multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Groq, HuggingFace) to ensure consistent service availability. When one provider experiences downtime or rate limiting, the system automatically suggests alternative providers, maintaining uninterrupted AI assistance.

### Progressive Web App Performance
Optimized the application for mobile devices through strategic code splitting, lazy loading of components, and efficient caching strategies. Service worker implementation ensures smooth offline experience while maintaining data synchronization when connectivity returns.

### Google Calendar Integration Complexity
Handled OAuth token management, refresh cycles, and API rate limiting through robust error handling and automatic token refresh mechanisms. The integration supports bidirectional synchronization while respecting Google's API limits and user privacy preferences.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
Ensured consistent user experience across different browsers, devices, and screen sizes through extensive testing and responsive design principles. PWA implementation provides native-like experience on mobile devices without requiring app store distribution.

### Scalable Database Architecture
Designed Supabase database schema with proper indexing, RLS policies, and efficient query patterns to support growing user base. Implemented proper data relationships and cascade deletions to maintain data integrity.
